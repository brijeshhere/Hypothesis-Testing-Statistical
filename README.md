Following Test were performed:

## T-test

1. One sample two-tailed mean: A statistical test used to determine whether the mean of a single sample of data is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean, where the alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean is not equal to the population mean.
2. One sample one-tailed mean: A statistical test used to determine whether the mean of a single sample of data is significantly greater than or less than a hypothesized population mean, where the alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean is either greater or less than the population mean.
3. Two sample two-tailed mean: A statistical test used to compare the means of two independent samples to determine if they are significantly different from each other, without specifying a direction for the difference.
4. Two sample one-tailed mean: A statistical test used to compare the means of two independent samples to determine if one is significantly greater than or less than the other, specifying a direction for the difference.

## Z-test

1. One sample two-tailed mean: A statistical test used to determine whether the mean of a single sample of data is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean, where the alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean is not equal to the population mean, when the sample size is large enough to assume a normal distribution.
2. One sample one-tailed proportion: A statistical test used to determine whether the proportion of a single sample of data is significantly greater than or less than a hypothesized population proportion, specifying a direction for the difference.
3. Two sample one-tailed proportion: A statistical test used to compare the proportions of two independent samples to determine if one is significantly greater than or less than the other, specifying a direction for the difference.
4. Two sample one-tailed mean: A statistical test used to compare the means of two independent samples to determine if one is significantly greater than or less than the other, specifying a direction for the difference.

## F-test

A statistical test used to compare the variances of two or more samples to determine if they are significantly different from each other.

## Chi square test

A statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables, by comparing the observed frequencies of the data with the expected frequencies.
